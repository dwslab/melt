This directory contains the source code for geenrating a reasonable subset of the reference alignments of various track at OAEI.
The final dataset as well as the evaluation of the matching systems (including the system results as well as the actual evaluation numbers)
can be found at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.25370548.v1 .
