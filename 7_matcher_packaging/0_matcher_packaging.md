# Matcher Packaging
In order to obtain modularized and re-usable matchers that can be shared, multiple packaging formats are available in the ontology matching domain.
These packages can be used to easily share matching systems with peers or to submit a matching system to the [Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI)](http://oaei.ontologymatching.org/).

MELT supports the packaging and evaluation of three packaging formats: SEALS, HOBBIT, and the Web Interface (HTTP Matching Interface).
